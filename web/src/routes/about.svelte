  <p class="p-6">Mandalas are procedurelly generated bitmaps recorded as NFT on <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank" class="underline">ethereum</a>. There are millions of millions of them, (2^160)-1 to be exact. <span class="uppercase">all unique</span>.</p>

  <p class="p-6">Their eight-fold simmetry also ensure that a single difference is actually repeated. As such they are also great for identity icon improving upon the classic <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/blockies" target="_blank" class="underline">blockies</a>. Their number is actually equal to the number of ethereum addresses and so each address has a unique representation in the form of a Mandala.</p>

  <p class="p-6">This website allows you to mint them on the <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank" class="underline">ethereum network</a>. Each time you mint you pay at a certain price and the price then increase. You can later burn the mandala to get back 95% of the current price. This is similar to <a class="underline" href="https://neolastics.com/" target="_blank">neolastics/</a> by <a class="underline" href="https://blog.simondlr.com/" target="_blank">Simon de la Rouviere</a> which I recommend to check out.</p>

  <p class="p-6">Mandalas have also the particularity that their bitmap and metadata is fully generated on-chain. And contrary to many other on-chain projects, Mandalas make full use of the tokenURI standard. Hence no backend will ever be required to host the image.</p>
